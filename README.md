## Analyzing the Impact of Lifestyle on Diabetes Risk
## Overview
This project aims to explore and visualize the relationship between lifestyle choices and the risk of developing diabetes. By leveraging a dataset that includes various lifestyle factors such as smoking habits, physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol intake, and socioeconomic indicators like income and education, the analysis seeks to identify key factors that influence the likelihood of diabetes.

## Key Features
